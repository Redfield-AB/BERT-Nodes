description: "Redfield BERT Nodes"
long_description: |
  This extension provides nodes that make the functionality of Google's BERT library available in the KNIME Analytics Platform.
  Currently, the extension is allows the training of text classification models as well as creating embeddings for texts.
  This extension is built on top of the TensorFlow 2 Python package. 
  It is also possible to execute BERT on GPU (nVidia CUDA-based).
  
  NOTE: The installation of this extension can fail on Windows if the installation folder of your Analytics Platform has a long path.
  This is due to Windows' long path limitations. You can circumvent this problem by enabling long path support as outlined here:
